"""
Tiny bootstrap for ReasonRDN.

Run this one-liner (no prior install needed):

    python -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Astrognosy-Ai/ReasonRDN/main/bootstrap.py)"

Or save it and run:
    python bootstrap.py

This will:
1. Ensure the package is installed with the full experience (dash + mcp + cli)
2. Print the "start using rdn" one-liner
3. Optionally launch the harness dashboard immediately

It solves the "I want persistent memory + metrics now" problem for any agent or human.

After this, agents get:
- One import: import rdn as reason
- Auto Xchange federation (when you want it)
- Real token savings tracking, velocity, ship rate, positive signals, workflow suggestions
- The dashboard that makes the value visible

This is the on-ramp to the warf reasoning substrate. High-quality handoffs you create here can eventually become callable deterministic artifacts in the network.

The long-term vision: high-quality, addressable reasoning artifacts make inference feel like resolution.
